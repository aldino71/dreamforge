# Dreamforge
## What is this.
This is Dino's application for worldbuidling in his D&D games. It uses a GPT instance that acts as an AI storytelling, worldbuilding "expert" called a Dreamsmith. You configure your own dreamsmith with your own ideas, characters, settings, and plotlines, and a Dreamsmith will iron out details and connection you may not have thought of. This tool should not be used to outsource creativity, but to allow you add and modify parts of your world using AI.
Hopefully, this software will allow you to create worlds and manage them faster than ever.
## How to use it.
I am working on that.

Basically, with no account, you can create a temporary dreamsmith with a set of configurations, similar to how you have different 'conversations' in ChatGPT. You can talk to it, bounce ideas, and generate new, small details for your world.

With an account, however, Dreamforge will store your world data and learn about it the more you talk with it. You can modify and change the data at any time to optimize your dreamsmiths and configure them for certain applications. The more you use Dreamforge, the more your dreamsmiths will work to build you the worlds you want.
